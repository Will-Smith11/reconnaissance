# Reconnaissance
The reconnaissance repo leverages the power of [Reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) and its modular design to get mass network exposure with very little overhead
while from the outside functioning as a healthy node. All of the networking should work correctly although the node currently is struggling to find peers. The transaction pool validator also seems to be causing some issues. However I've decided to ignore this because the transaction pool is still under [development](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues/36)
